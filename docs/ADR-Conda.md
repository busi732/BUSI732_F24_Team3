# ADR - Selection of Conda for Environment Management

**Date:** 11-11-2024

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

This project involves optimizing turbine maintenance and energy production. The core task requires using optimization libraries (like Scipy, PuLP, Pyomo), alongside other packages such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Managing these dependencies efficiently is critical for ensuring reproducibility, avoiding version conflicts, and enabling a smooth development and deployment process.

## Decision

Conda was selected as the environment and package manager for this project for the following reasons: 
- Comprehensive Package Management: Conda is a powerful tool for managing both Python and non-Python dependencies, which is crucial given that this project may require system-level dependencies.
- Reproducibility: By using Conda, we ensure that the project's dependencies are captured in environment files (environment.yml), making it easy to reproduce the exact environment on different machines, whether for other team members or for deployment.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Conda is cross-platform and can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Ecosystem Integration: Conda integrates well with the Python ecosystem and supports a wide variety of data science, scientific computing, and optimization libraries, which are key for this project (e.g., Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib).

## Consequences

Positive:
- Easy environment setup and dependency management for all team members.
- Better compatibility with packages that require non-Python dependencies (e.g., C extensions or system libraries).
- Reproducibility across different systems.
- Simplified onboarding process for new developers or contributors.

Negative:
- Conda environments can be large, and there may be some initial overhead in setting up environments and solving dependencies.
- There may be some additional time required for understanding Conda for team members unfamiliar with it.

## Alternatives Considered

Poetry
- Strengths: Poetry simplifies dependency management by using automatic dependency resolution and integrates both environment and packaging management into a single tool.
It works well for Python-only projects and provides clear version management using pyproject.toml.
- Weaknesses: Poetry is less suited to managing non-Python dependencies or complex cross-platform environments (e.g., data science environments with heavy C/C++ dependencies).
Transitioning from traditional pip-based workflows to Poetry may have a learning curve, particularly for teams unfamiliar with its ecosystem.

pip + virtualenv
- Strengths: pip and virtualenv are the most commonly used combination for managing Python dependencies and environments. Both tools are lightweight and widely supported in the Python ecosystem. pip installs Python packages directly from PyPI, and virtualenv creates isolated environments, allowing for package version control and conflict avoidance. This combination avoids the need for a more heavyweight tool like Conda, focusing solely on Python-related packages and environments.
- Weaknesses: Unlike Conda or Poetry, pip and virtualenv require manual handling of dependencies and package versions. Resolving complex dependencies can be more cumbersome without automatic dependency resolution, especially in larger projects with intricate version conflicts. If the project involves non-Python dependencies (e.g., system libraries), pip and virtualenv donâ€™t offer the same cross-platform environment management as Conda.
