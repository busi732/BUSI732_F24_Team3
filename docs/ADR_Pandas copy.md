# ADR: Choosing Cookiecutter vs Alternatives for Project Setup

**date:** [12/11/2024]

**status:** Approved

## Context

The team is initiating development on a single project and needs to standardize the structure and setup. While tools like Cookiecutter are often used for templating multiple projects, we are evaluating its suitability for our single-project needs.

Key requirements for this decision include:

- A clean and consistent project structure.
- Ease of setup and maintainability.
- Minimal overhead since we are working on only one project.
- Flexibility to accommodate project-specific customizations.

The decision revolves around whether to use **Cookiecutter**, a popular project templating tool, or alternative approaches like manual setup or bespoke scripts.

## Decision

We have decided to use **Cookiecutter** for this single project to streamline the setup process.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Cookiecutter**
- **Pros:**
  - Facilitates reusable and consistent project templates.
  - Reduces human error in setting up the initial project structure.
  - Supports custom templating logic for specific use cases.
- **Cons:**
  - Adds some initial complexity in understanding and configuring templates.

### 2. **Manual Setup**
- **Pros:**
  - Direct and straightforward for a single project.
  - No additional dependencies or learning curve.
  - Full control over the structure, allowing for ad-hoc changes.
- **Cons:**
  - Higher likelihood of inconsistent structure if multiple developers are involved.
  - Potentially slower initial setup compared to automated tools.

### 3. **Custom Setup Script**
- **Pros:**
  - Automates setup while remaining tailored to the projectâ€™s specific requirements.
  - Flexible and lightweight compared to Cookiecutter.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires time and effort to create the script.
  - Limited value unless the script can be reused for other projects.

## Rationale

### Why Cookiecutter?
1. **Consistency:**
   - Cookiecutter ensures a standardized project structure, reducing ambiguity and setup errors.

2. **Time Efficiency:**
   - Automates the creation of boilerplate code and directory structures, saving time compared to manual setup.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - Allows customization of templates to fit the specific needs of the project.

4. **Future Readiness:**
   - While we are working on a single project, using Cookiecutter now builds familiarity for potential future multi-project use cases.

### Why Not Alternatives?
1. **Manual Setup:**
   - While straightforward, it risks inconsistency and may be slower for the initial setup.

2. **Custom Setup Script:**
   - The effort required to create a bespoke script is not justified for this single project.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Consistent and clean project structure from the outset.
- Reduced likelihood of setup errors.
- Faster onboarding for new developers due to a predictable structure.

### Negative:
- Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Cookiecutter.
- Slight upfront time investment in configuring the template.

## Mitigation Plan

- Provide team training and documentation on using Cookiecutter templates effectively.
- Customize the Cookiecutter template to precisely match the project's needs, minimizing unnecessary complexity.
- Revisit the decision if project requirements change or if multiple projects arise in the future.
