    "\n",
    "- GF (Generator Heating Fault): Indicates overheating or related issues in the generator, which could suggest an overload or poor cooling in the generator unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MF (Mains Failure Fault): Reflects a failure in the main power supply, likely causing interruptions or necessitating backup power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- FF (Feeding Fault): Relates to issues in the feeding mechanism, which might impact fuel or resource input, affecting the systemâ€™s operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AF (Air Cooling Fault): Points to problems with air cooling, likely resulting in increased temperatures if the cooling system is ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EF (Excitation Fault): would typically relate to issues in the generator's excitation system, affecting voltage regulation."
